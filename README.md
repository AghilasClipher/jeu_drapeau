# My First Web Project: making a flag game with a map ! 

As part of my last year in 'licence' at Paris 13 University, I am working on a web project which consists of creating a flag game using a Leaflet map. The game consists of: -showing to the player a certain country flag, which the player has to indicate with a marker on the map the location of the country. :)
